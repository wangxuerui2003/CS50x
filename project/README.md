Firstly you have to login in order to access anything else of the app.

After you login, you can check your tasks on the index (main) page, you can add tasks by clicking the big add button at the bottom right corner.

The tasks you've created today will be marked as expired if you don't finish it today, but you can still refresh it to be a task for today!

You can manage your habit in the habit menu, unfortunately you can have only one ongoing habit, so you gotta focus!!

You may change colorscheme and password on the settings dropdown menu. You may also logout there.
